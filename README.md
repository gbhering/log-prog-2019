# log-prog-2019
code for class assignments for programming logic

## Basic implementation
Observe there is no error handling whatsoever, the user is entirely responsible for providing a well formed/formatted formula.

### Format
Provide a `str()` with one space between each literal and operator, and a `dict()` with `bool()` values for each literal. 
Examples can be found in the code.

### Operators
`OR`, `AND`, `NOT`, `(` and `)`
